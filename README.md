# AdventOfCode
My first year of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
With varying time on my hand, the solutions span from quick-and-dirty to elaborate on a daily basis <sup>tbh mostly the former.. ;)</sup>

In general, I had little time to optimize my code with exams and assignments.
However, that wasn´t my aim here. I wanted to get as many solutions as possible while practising my Java proficiency.
