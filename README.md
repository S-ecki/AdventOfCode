# Advent Of Code 2020
My first year of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) <br/>
With varying time on my hand, the solutions span from quick-and-dirty to elaborate <sup>tbh mostly the former.. ;)</sup>

In general, I had little time to optimize my code with exams and assignments. <br/>
However, that wasnÂ´t my aim here. I wanted to get as many solutions as possible while practising my Java proficiency.
